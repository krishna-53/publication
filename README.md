ðŸ§  Breast Cancer Detection Using Pre-Processed Images and Ensemble Learning

This repository presents a machine learning approach to improve breast cancer detection using image pre-processing and classifier fusion techniques. The project implements and evaluates three classifiersâ€”Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Treeâ€”on pre-processed mammogram images. It then fuses their results using ensemble methods to improve diagnostic accuracy.

ðŸ“Œ Abstract

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. While several machine learning techniques exist for its detection, their effectiveness is often limited by poor image quality. This work enhances detection accuracy by applying advanced image pre-processing techniques such as background removal, noise reduction, and contrast enhancement. The pre-processed images are classified using CNN, KNN, and Decision Tree models. The final diagnosis is improved through ensemble fusion techniques (mean and max), achieving superior performance over individual classifiers.
